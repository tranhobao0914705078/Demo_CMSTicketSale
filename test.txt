I have more than 1 year of experience working on real projects using React, TypeScript, and PHP (Laravel) technologies, I'm a recent graduate, and I did a course project at school using PHP (Laravel), and 3 months working on real projects at the company using React, TypeScript, Redux. I am always learning new technologies and developing more about user UI/UX.
